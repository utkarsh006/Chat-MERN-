## What I learned through this Project?

- Web Sockets and Socket.IO: Throughout this project, I learned about Web Sockets and their implementation using Socket.io. Including broadcasting messages to multiple clients, handling different events, implementing acknowledgments and handling disconnect and error events.
- Context API: As part of this project, I also learned about the Context API. I gained an understanding of how to use it in React to manage global state and share data between components without the need for prop drilling
- UI with Chakra UI: I learned to built a user friendly UI design using Chakra UI.
